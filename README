This is an experimental version of XPMEM based on a version provided by
Cray and uploaded to https://code.google.com/p/xpmem

XPMEM is a Linux kernel module that enables a process to map the memory of another process into its virtual address space. Source code can be obtained by cloning the Mercurial repository or by downloading a tarball from the Downloads link above.

The XPMEM API has three main functions:

  xpmem_make()    
  xpmem_get()
  xpmem_attach()

A process calls xpmem_make() to export a region of its virtual address space. Other processes can then attach to the region by calling xpmem_get() and xpmem_attach(). After a memory region is attached, it is accessed via direct loads and stores. This enables upper-level protocols such as MPI and SHMEM to perform single-copy address-space to address-space transfers, completely at user-level.

XPMEM regions are free to have "holes" in them, meaning virtual memory regions that are not allocated. This makes XPMEM somewhat more flexible than mmap(). A process could, for example, export a region via XPMEM starting at address 0 and extending 4 GB. Accesses to allocated (valid) virtual addresses in this region proceed normally, and pages are mapped between address spaces on demand. A segfault will occur if the source process or any other process mapping the region tries to access an unallocated (invalid) virtual address in the region.
